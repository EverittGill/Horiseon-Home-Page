# Horiseon Home Page

## Description


This webpage was created to be a home page for Horiseon. A digital marketing firm specializing in SEO, online reputation management, and social media marketing. This page will serve to be the the first thing visitors see when choosing to look into Horiseon as an advertising firm.


- This page was created to be used as a primary landing page if a potential client searches for Horiseon on a search engine or follows a link from one of our own advertisements promoting Horiseon. It will also serve to be a home page for other web pages about Horiseon.

- The primary problem this page solves is very basic. Horiseon needed a website to educate potential clients about our company and this page serves as the home page.

- In the process of building this page I learned 
    - The different use cases for IDs and classes and how to determine when to use them. 
    - CSS Flexbox
    - The importance of using Semantic HTML elements and how to implement them
    - Keeping the file structure of a website organized in a way that Github can display them with Gitpages.
    - Roughly 10 git commands that were needed to fix errors
